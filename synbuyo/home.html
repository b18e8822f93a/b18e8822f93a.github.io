         Minimum compliance, Minimum Cost, Minimum Work
         Alternative solution.
         One of my roles was to assess providers for the compliance at the trading house, many of thos were really good
         offerings particular, great ui excellent engineering.<p></p>
         Ironically the main issue is the abundance of features and associated complexity within these offerings.
         Our compliance team simply required the minimal effort to fulfull the newly declared ****, they also need a
         historical record.<p></p>
         The offering often comingled other offerings such as trading performance, price presure, algo suggestions etc.
         When the brief from the compliance team is all we want is green tick under our compliance obligations, nothing
         more, it doesnt need to be a huge adminstration exercise, cost should be resonable, it ture this service and
         others leverage the cloud and some machine learning but we'll be honest
         in terms of programmatic challenge, it can be overbaked, the real values is in having an easy use that you can
         be confident fulfills your compliance wiht minimum adminstration and minium cost.
         hi welcome to end of day file A rethink on the compilance requirements. as a
         developer for nearly a decaded in the power and gas commodities space it was my
         role to assess optoins for compilance software. often time the offering although
         often excellent was quite over engineer with functional above and beyond the
         requirement We found a much simplier solution, request the end of day files from
         trayport, these are dropped to an online folder, then have a very simple script,
         can then access this file and perform the compute the relatively simple
         calculation to kj and have a simple report emailed with a clear indication if
         compilance rule has been broken. Request end of day from trayport, this is
         approximatel £1k month charge Fill in a form an email address, the link to the
         ftp, the ftp password Security is paramount, you do not set up an account as
         such , you provide these details, these are hashed If you want to cancel the
         report you simply put in the same detail and uncheck any services.
         And this is great is that's what you needed, but it was actualy all just redundant to our team and effectively
         added to the administration of the compliance team for what should be an atomic
         <p></p>
         Do we really need a softare as a solution for this offering, another login etc.
