Since our inception, we have been futureproofing DC’s business through focused business development – and our mission is clear: we will expand DC’s business model globally, we will develop new markets and together with Equinor we will push the energy transition forward, starting from our home turf. Joining Origination, you will become part of the customer-facing unit at DC. We are the link between DC’s Physical Asset Management and Trading on one hand and Business Relationship Management on the other hand. As the link to our customers, you will conduct analyses, develop new business strategies and be responsible for selling our products and services.

Starting out, you will get a thorough introduction to DC, the Global Trading &amp; Market Development unit and other relevant internal stakeholders. After your introduction, the focus will be on marketing Equinor’s renewable production (both equity and partner volume) to the Polish market. Your primary goal will be to build a strong market position in Poland. To achieve this goal, you will be physically located at Equinor’s office in Warsaw, working shoulder to shoulder with our Equinor colleagues, who are responsible for the project development of renewables.</p></li><li class="list-group-item wrapPlease"><h6>Required</h6><ul class="card-text"><li>hold a relevant master’s degree</li><li>have a minimum of five years’ experience from a similar position in the energy space</li><li>are fluent in Polish and English – both written and verbal</li><li>are independent, proactive and outgoing as you will cooperate with colleagues and stakeholders across the organisation</li><li>have a winning and competitive attitude as the team operates in ever-changing energy markets</li><li>take a holistic approach to your job as you have an eye for market risk but also find it natural to evaluate other factors in your analyses</li><li>take a positive view: no job too big, no job too small as the team covers a wide range of tasks and we always help each other in getting the job done</li></ul></li><li class="list-group-item wrapPlease"><h6>Responsibilities</h6><ul class="card-text"><li>actively manage and build relationships with existing and new customers in the chosen customer market segments</li><li>evaluate requests for bids, lead bid preparation, prepare competitive analysis and manage participation in tender processes</li><li>prepare proposals and presentation materials for customers and buyers</li><li>seek opportunities and deal structures that allow for bilateral transactions with customers</li><li>negotiate terms and conditions of power purchase agreements</li><li>drive transactions toward closure</li><li>represent DC at national renewable energy events as a speaker, panelist and energy leader</li></ul></li></ul><div class="card-footer text-muted"><span class="mr-1 text-muted" style="float: right">Expires in 22 Days</span></div></div></div></body><footer><div class="content-bottom w-100 d-flex align-items-center"><div class="container"><div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between"><span class="footer-references">&#169;2020 Synthase Limited.
